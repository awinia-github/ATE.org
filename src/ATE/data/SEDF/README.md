# SEDF (<ins>S</ins>tandard <ins>E</ins>prom <ins>D</ins>ata <ins>F</ins>ormat)  library

In the semiconductor test industry, virtually on every [PCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) one finds some kind of [EPROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM). 

This is done for a varity of reasons like:
  - auto-detection of (PCB) board type
  - store/track calibration data
  - store/track maintenance data
  - ...
  
pro

`SEDF` defines records (inspired by STDF, hence the library name choice) to store bits and pieces of information based on a 'key'.
