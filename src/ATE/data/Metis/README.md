# Metis

## mythology [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(mythology))
Metis (/ˈmiːtɪs/; Greek: Μῆτις, "<ins>wisdom</ins>," "<ins>skill</ins>," or "<ins>craft</ins>"), in ancient Greek religion, was a mythical Titaness belonging to the second generation of Titans.

By the era of Greek philosophy in the 5th century BC, Metis had become the <ins>mother of wisdom</ins> and <ins>deep thought</ins>, but her name originally connoted "<ins>magical cunning</ins>" and was as easily equated with the <ins>trickster</ins> powers of Prometheus as with the "royal metis" of Zeus.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(mythology)#cite_note-Brown-1) The Stoic commentators allegorised Metis as the embodiment of "prudence", "wisdom" or "wise counsel", in which form she was inherited by the Renaissance.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(mythology)#cite_note-2)
