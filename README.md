# ATE.org
`ATE.org` is a tester- and instrument **AGNOSTIC** framework for **<ins>(Automotive Mixed Signal) ATE ASIC testing</ins>** projects. This means that the system is **not** build around a specific instrument (let's consider an ATE tester for a moment as a super instrumentðŸ˜‹), it rather focuses on 
organizing semiconductor testing (hence the project name: ATE.org) in such a way that all special corner cases have
their well known place. This enables the users (read: TE's & PE's) to focus on the **REAL** work : <ins>writing test</ins>.
