The name 'actions' should stay, but instead of organizing by
type of action ('clone', 'compare', ...) it is probably better to organize
according to the 'items' ('maskset', 'die', ...) and under those the possible
actions ...

... not sure if we should do this re-facturing sooner or later ...

probably sooner, as now we only have 'new' actions :-)

OK, leave this workpackage to me (Tom)
