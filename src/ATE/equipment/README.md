This package contains EQUIPMENT, so anything that is *NOT* an INSTRUMENT.
Things that belong here :
    - probers (drivers)
    - handler (drivers)
    - TCC (Test Cell Controller)
    - thermostreams (drivers)
    - coildrivers (drivers)
    - ...
    
We organize the contents per MANUFACTURER of the equipment
WE are also a manufacturer in a sense, but this applies only to TCC
so TCC will be at the top level as a 'Manufacturer' if you want.
