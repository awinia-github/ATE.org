This directory contains :
    1) The 'company' specific plugins (holding importers and shit)
    2) The 'tester' plugin (as ATE itself is tester agnostic)
    3)  for companies
belonging to the TDK group.

In a later stage this needs to be moved out, but for now, we will keep 
them here.

... not sure if this is workable in conjunction with 'pluggy' ...
